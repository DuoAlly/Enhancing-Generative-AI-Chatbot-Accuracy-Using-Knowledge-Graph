Over a two-semester period, students work with either internal (university) or external (business) clients to complete a project. The projects are very close to a real world software engineering experience. Students work in teams of three to ten, with a faculty mentor guiding the team through the entire software lifecycle. Students experience all aspects of software engineering including interviewing a client, domain analysis, requirements gathering, specification, design techniques including UML and ER diagrams, use cases, paper prototypes, iterative development, and user acceptance testing.\\xa0 In addition, students develop valuable communications skills and learn how to properly interact with a client and how to work effectively in a team.Why do students have to take Graduate Directed Project?The two-semester Graduate Directed Project is in lieu of the normal thesis requirement for master’s level programs. Since our program is applied in nature and is designed to prepare you for the job market, engaging in a software development project better fits the goals of the MS-Applied Computer Science program.What are students required to do in Graduate Directed Project?Students are assigned to teams of 3-10 each. They are also assigned a faculty member to serve as their mentor. Projects are assigned to each team, and students normally are involved in all steps of a software development project, from gathering requirements from the client to deploying the finished product.Can students pick their own teams?A faculty committee assigns students to teams. Students may request to work with certain students, but there is no guarantee that their request will be honored. Many factors must be considered when teams are formed, including the balance of expertise and the background of the students involved.Can a student suggest a project?Anyone can suggest a project for a graduate directed project team. However, the proposal must be in written form and must supply sufficient detail for the faculty committee to make a decision.What if a team starts on their project in the spring and some team members are planning to continue in the summer, but others do not want to attend during the summer and want to wait until fall to complete the project.When teams are initially assigned, we make every effort to ensure that all team members have the same completion date in mind. If circumstances change, and some team members want to complete in the summer, with others completing in the fall, we will work out a solution. No student will be forced to attend in the summer, or to wait until fall, for completion of the project.How are clients chosen?We solicit clients from our own school, from other offices in the university, and from companies and businesses off-campus.\\xa0 Potential clients submit a proposal, and a faculty committee selects those proposals that seem to be suitable for a Graduate Directed Project team.List Of Projects\\n\\n2023-24\\n2022-23\\n2021-22\\n2020-21\\n2019-20\\n2018-19\\n2017-18\\n2016-17\\n2015-16\\n2014-15\\n2013-14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2012-13\\n2011-12\\n2010-11\\n2009-10\\n2008-09\\n2007-08\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReady to be a Bearcat?\\n\\nRequest Info\\nSchedule a Visit\\nApply Now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorthwest Missouri State University 800 University Drive Maryville, MO 64468 USA\\n660.562.1212\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCampus Links\\n\\nAcademic Calendar\\nEmergency Alert Sign Up\\nNews and Events\\nMaps and Tours\\nConsumer Information\\n\\n Report an Incident\\n\\nAffiliates\\n\\nAlumni\\nAthletics\\nChildren/Lab School\\nJobs at Northwest\\nMake a Gift\\nNorthwest Online\\nNorthwest-Kansas City\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact\\nFeedback\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2022 Northwest Missouri State University.

The student may get a chance to work on that research work with the faculty.\\nHowever, all the students have to explore and work on graduate directed projects as part of their program. The list of projects finished by earlier students can be found at the projects page link.\\nIndependent Studies\\nMS-ACS program provides flexibility to the students to work on an independent project in their area of interest. The student can work on any project of their interest using technology, under the guidance of a faculty and can finish this course within the time allotted. This course provides the opportunity for students to explore any technology or project that is not available in the program as of now. This is considered as an independent course, post completion of this course, 1 hour will be added to the student's degree audit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReady to be a Bearcat?\\n\\nRequest Info\\nSchedule a Visit\\nApply Now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorthwest Missouri State University 800 University Drive Maryville, MO 64468 USA\\n660.562.1212\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCampus Links\\n\\nAcademic Calendar\\nEmergency Alert Sign Up\\nNews and Events\\nMaps and Tours\\nConsumer Information\\n\\n Report an Incident\\n\\nAffiliates\\n\\nAlumni\\nAthletics\\nChildren/Lab School\\nJobs at Northwest\\nMake a Gift\\nNorthwest Online\\nNorthwest-Kansas City\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContact\\nFeedback\\nPolicies\\n\\n\\n\\n© 2022 Northwest Missouri State University.

A summer internship will provide you with an opportunity to see how the concepts and skills learned in the classroom translate to real projects in industry.\\nIt is the student's responsibility to make the appropriate contacts to obtain an internship. An internship may be either on campus or off-campus. A student may or may not be paid for internship work. Students may or may not earn academic credit for an internship. Students who desire academic credit will sign up for a one-credit-hour section of 44-699 Graduate Internship in Information Technology or 44-599 Special Projects - Independent Study Computer Science. For details about 44-699 or 44-599, see CSIS Internship Policies and Procedures\\xa0.\\nSPECIAL NOTES FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO WANT SUMMER INTERNSHIPS:\\nThe School of Computer Science and Information Systems at Northwest Missouri State University participates in the CPT (curricular practical training) program for international students. Note some restrictions on CPT:\\n\\nThe School of Computer Science and Information Systems will support requests for CPT for the summer semester. Fall and spring CPT requests may\\xa0be granted, depending on the circumstances.\\nCPT requires that a student\\xa0be enrolled full time for one academic year (two semesters) before becoming eligible for CPT. This means that students enrolling for the first time in the fall are eligible for CPT the following summer. However, students enrolling for the first time in the spring are not eligible for CPT until they have completed an additional semester of study.\\nCPT guidelines require that you enroll in an internship course. MS-ACS students will enroll in a one-credit-hour section of 44-699 Graduate Internship in Information Technology\\n\\nThe following documents provide more details regarding CPT and internship policies and procedures:\\n\\nStudent Procedure (Sample )\\nEmployer Procedure (Sample )\\nAcademic Advisor Letter (Sample )\\nFaculty Procedure (Sample )\\nJob Offer Letter (Sample )\\nCSIS Internship Policies and Procedures\\xa0For all students, both international and non-international\\nWeekly Log templateThis is a sample template; your instructor may require that you use a different template.\\n\\nHelp for Job\\xa0Interviews\\nTo learn more about interviewing and creating résumés, enroll in 44-296 Professional Development Seminar. This is a one-credit hour, undergraduate course that will prepare you to interview for internships and full-time jobs. You will also learn how to create effective résumés. This course is NOT required and does NOT count toward the MS in Applied Computer Science program, but it is highly recommended.\\nIn the meantime, here are some helpful hints that might be of use. These are general documents and apply to a wide variety of situations. You must adapt the suggestions to fit the situation. Applying for a student job on campus is not the same as applying for a full-time job upon graduation. Basic rules apply to both situations, but details may differ.

This document is prepared by the International Involvement Center (IIC). It provides much useful information regarding the next steps after receiving your visa. For more information contact Connie Murphy and IIC (intlprog@nwmissouri.edu).Do I have to purchase health insurance in the United States? What vaccines do I need to have before I arrive?Students must purchase health insurance at Northwest. For the year 2022-2023, the annual cost is around $1,500.00.Regarding the Vaccines, you need to at least complete MMR (1st dose) and if you live on campus you need to even take Meningitis.For all students, both international and non-international:How does the Master of Science in Applied Computer Science differ from programs in Computer Science?The MS in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University differs from other programs in computer science in some significant ways:\\nThe focus of this program is to prepare students to enter a very competitive job market by increasing their skills in high-demand areas and emerging technologies. Many master\\'s programs in computer science have a more theoretical basis because the aim of the program is to prepare students to go on for more graduate work at the Ph.D. level. Our program covers theoretical concepts, but students also gain hands-on experience and have strong technical skills when they graduate from the program.\\nOur program requirements include six credit hours of course work (two courses) that look at information technology issues from a business perspective. In many computer science programs there is no coverage of business issues.\\nIn place of the thesis requirement required by many programs, our program requires a year-long, six-credit hour project that provides students with the opportunity to apply their knowledge to a software project.\\nThe primary goals of this program are to produce graduates that\\n\\nhave a high degree of competence in areas of high-demand and emerging technologies\\nhave good project management skills and will understand fundamental business concepts, as related specifically to information technology\\nhave experience in design and implementation of a large project\\nknow how to work in teams\\nhave good written communication and presentation skills\\n\\nTo ensure that our program meets these goals, we get regular feedback from potential employers. Feedback for this program has been very positive with employers confirming that we have the right mix of theory and practice. They have been particularly positive about the inclusion of the two business-related courses because they frequently encounter problems with \"techies\" being unable to communicate with others in the organization.What work opportunities are available? Can I get a graduate assistantship?\\n\\nThere are many work opportunities available on campus for students few among them are office Assistants, Student ambassadors, Teaching assistants, Campus Dine-in jobs, Graduate Assistants, and many more. Every student would be eligible for a Graduate Assistantship based on their performance in the semesters, proactiveness, and active participation in the class.\\nIn any semester if you get a full graduate assistantship or 3/4th graduate assistantship or 1/2 graduate assistantship, your 100% or 75% or 50% of the tuition fee will be waived off, respectively. Click here to review the Graduate and Teaching Assistant Opportunities:\\xa0https://www.nwmissouri.edu/hr/student/index.htm\\n\\nWhat is the typical class size?Class sizes are generally small, so you can get individual attention from the instructor. Average class size is approximately 27 students. If we get an unexpectedly large number of students joining the program, then class sizes may be slightly larger than the figures indicated here. In some cases, we have larger sections (40-45 students) that meet once a week; for the second meeting of the week, the class is split into two smaller sections.Do I need to bring a laptop with me?No, you do not need to bring a laptop with you. All full-time students are provided a laptop by the university.Please explain the credit hour system used.Each required course in the major is three credit hours. This means the class meets for approximately three hours per week. You are expected to work outside of class also. Undergraduates take about 15 credit hours per semester, but the normal load for a graduate student is nine credit hours (three courses) per semester. It is possible to take twelve credit hours (four courses) as a graduate student, but you should talk with your advisor before doing this. During the semesters that you are enrolled in Directed Graduate Project, it is especially important that you do not enroll in an excessive number of hours.How are grades determined?When you begin a course, the instructor will provide a syllabus for the course which, among other things, describes the grading criteria for the course. This can vary from course to course, but generally the grading criteria will include exams, quizzes, projects, and assignments. The instructor will also include a grading scale to show you how final grades are determined. For most instructors, each item (exam, quiz, project, etc) is assigned a point value. At the end of the term you must have a certain percentage of the total point values for an A, a certain percentage for a B, and so forth.What kind of research activities are the faculty involved in?Note that we do not offer a doctoral program at Northwest Missouri State University, and therefore research is limited. The highest degree we offer in computer science is the Master of Science in Applied Computer Science. The primary purpose of the program is to prepare students to succeed in a very competitive job market, so the focus of the program is different from what you find in programs designed to lead to a doctoral degree.\\nOur faculty is very active professionally. Faculty members present papers regularly at professional meetings and attend conferences and seminars in order to stay up on current technologies. Special areas of interest include artificial intelligence, database systems, computer networks, web services, human-computer interaction, component-based development, and programming languages. For more specific details about individual faculty members, see faculty page.My admission letter says that I need to take 44-460 Database Systems. Can you tell me more about this course?44-460 Database Systems is a senior level course, emphasizing design concepts and ER modeling. In addition, SQL is covered extensively. Students who enter the MS program and do not have an undergraduate course in database systems must take 44-460 before they can enroll in 44-560 Advanced Topics in Database Systems.How can I pay my fees?The Office of Student Account Services will accept cash, credit card, flywire, or traveler\\'s checks. For new students registering during the general registration period in the week prior to classes beginning, one-fourth of tuition is due on the day they enroll. The remaining payments are scheduled throughout the semester.\\nChecks should be made out to Northwest Missouri State UniversityCan you give an estimate of the total expenses for the first year?This information is an approximation only. Fees are based on the best information\\xa0currently available for years 2021-22.\\nTo determine tuition fees, go to Graduate Fee Calculator. With a normal load, a graduate student will take 9 credit hours per semester. If you have deficiencies, you may take up to 12 credit hours per semester. The more credit hours you take, the higher the tuition costs.\\nWhen using the Graduate Fee Calculator, you must select out-of-state for your first semester fees. However, some reduction of fees may be possible after the first semester for qualifying students. See financial assistance for details.\\nInternational students must purchase health insurance if they do not have their own health insurance. For the cost of health insurance, see the\\xa0estimated cost for international students. Note that the total cost on this page includes estimates for personal expenses and on-campus living expenses. These costs may be different if you choose to live off-campus.How can I arrange for housing? Should I live off-campus or on-campus?On-campus housing is available. Information about on-campus housing was included in your I-20 packet. Most graduate students live off-campus. Popular apartments include:\\n\\nHorizons West, 660.582.5211 (adjacent to campus)\\nVillage O, 660.582.7725 (about 1 or 1-1/2 miles from campus)\\nNorthridge, 660.582.3927 (adjacent to campus)\\nWhat should one know about Northwest Missouri State University and how is it different from other institutions?We offer a practical program that provides you with the skills you need to find employment when you graduate; we believe you learn by doing, so we have a hands-on approach to our classes\\n\\nwe have one of the safest campuses in the United States\\nyou will have lots of personal attention from the faculty\\nNorthwest has low tuition, relative to most other schools\\nwe have a beautiful campus, with about 1300 trees and 125 different species (we are the Missouri State Arboretum)\\nwe also provide good scholarships. See financial assistance for details.\\n\\nNorthwest’s niche is to provide first-rate, high-quality bachelor’s and master’s degree programs. The quality of these programs is evidenced by our large enrollment in the MS-ACS program and the success our graduates have in obtaining jobs; at the bachelor’s level, our school just received a grant in excess of $500,000 from the National Science Foundation to support recruitment and retention of undergraduates in Computer Science through scholarships and an extensive mentoring program.\\xa0 This kind of recognition speaks well to the quality of our programs at Northwest.If you have\\xa0 more questions about our program, visit the program website at https://www.nwmissouri.edu/academics/graduate/masters/applied-computer-science.htm. Look under the FAQs button to see how the MS-ACS program is different from other programs. Look under https://www.nwmissouri.edu/csis/directory/index.htm to find research interests for faculty.
